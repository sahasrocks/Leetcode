        When a word is found, we will perform the following actions:
        
        - Set the word node's "word" to None
        - If the current word node's child count is 0, we will
          traverse up node's parent and "evict" the child. We will
          perform this check up to trie until we reach a node who's child
          count is not zero OR we are at the root
          
        The reason why we do this is because we only need to match
        a word once. So we will improve subsequent word searches by
        pruning branches to words we've already found. We always check if
        a node's child count is 0 because we don't want to prune
        a branch if there are still words further down.
        
        For example:
            
            "bat", "batter", "battery"
        
        If we found "bat", then "bat" is no longer an eligible word.
        However, "batter" and "battery" are both further down the
        trie, so we don't prune this branch yet.
        
        If we found "battery" next, then this branch would be pruned
        to "bat", "batter".
        
        Finally, after finding "batter", we will prune the entire
        "bat..." branch.
